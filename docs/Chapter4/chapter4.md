# Rules for Calculating Hardware Arithmetic Bit Widths

When designing digital hardware, determining the correct bit width for arithmetic operations is crucial to ensure accuracy and prevent overflow or underflow. Here are some general rules:

## 1. Addition and Subtraction
- **Result Bit Width:**  
    For two unsigned numbers of widths `n` and `m`, the result requires `max(n, m) + 1` bits.
    - Example: 8-bit + 8-bit → 9 bits

- **Signed Numbers:**  
    For two signed numbers, use `max(n, m) + 1` bits to accommodate sign extension and overflow.

## 2. Multiplication
- **Result Bit Width:**  
    For multiplying an `n`-bit number by an `m`-bit number, the result requires `n + m` bits.
    - Example: 8-bit × 8-bit → 16 bits

## 3. Division
- **Quotient Bit Width:**  
    The quotient of an `n`-bit dividend by an `m`-bit divisor requires up to `n` bits.
- **Remainder Bit Width:**  
    The remainder requires up to `m` bits.

## 4. Shifting
- **Left Shift:**  
    Shifting left by `k` bits increases the value by `2^k`, but does not increase bit width unless overflow is possible.
- **Right Shift:**  
    Shifting right reduces the value; bit width remains the same.

## 5. Accumulators
- **Accumulation:**  
    For summing `N` values of `n` bits, use `n + log2(N)` bits to prevent overflow.

## 6. General Tips
- Always consider sign extension for signed arithmetic.
- Account for worst-case scenarios to avoid data loss.
- Use simulation or formal verification to validate bit width choices.


## 7. Underflow and Overflow Protection
